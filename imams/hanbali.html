        Abū ʿAbdillāh Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Ḥanbal Ash-Shaybānī), often
        referred to as Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal or Ibn Ḥanbal for short, was an Arab
        Muslim jurist, theologian, ascetic, hadith traditionist, and founder of
        the Hanbali school of Sunni jurisprudence — one of the four major
        orthodox legal schools of Sunni Islam.

      <h4>Some Points And Accomplishments of Ibn Hanbal</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>
          Born November 780 CE Rabi-ul-Awwal 164 AH[1] Baghdad, Abbasid
          Caliphate
        </li>
        <li>
          Ahmad ibn Hanbal's family was originally from Basra, Iraq, and
          belonged to the Arab Banu Shayban tribe.[
        </li>
        <li>
          Imam Ahmed studied extensively in Baghdad, and later traveled to
          further his education. He started learning jurisprudence (Fiqh) under
          the celebrated Hanafi judge, Abu Yusuf, the renowned student and
          companion of Imaam Abu Hanifah.
        </li>
        <li>
          After finishing his studies with Abu Yusuf, ibn Hanbal began traveling
          through Iraq, Syria, and Arabia to collect hadiths, or traditions of
          the Prophet Muhammad.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ibn al-Jawzi states that Imam Ahmad had 414 Hadith masters whom he
          narrated from. With this knowledge, he became a leading authority on
          the hadith, leaving an immense encyclopedia of hadith, al-Musnad.
        </li>
        <li>
          After several years of travel, he returned to Baghdad to study Islamic
          law under Al-Shafi'i.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ahmad became a mufti in his old age, and founded the Hanbali madhab,
          or school of Islamic law, which is now most dominant in Saudi Arabia,
          Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike the other three schools of
          Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, and Shafi), the Hanbali madhab
          remained largely traditionalist or Athari in theology.
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition to his scholastic enterprises, ibn Hanbal was a soldier on
          the Islamic frontiers (Ribat) and made Hajj five times in his life,
          twice on foot.
        </li>
        <li>
          ibn Hanbal was imprisoned in Baghdad throughout the reign of
          al-Ma'mun.
        </li>
        <li>
          ibn Hanbal passed away on Friday, 12 Rabi-ul-awwal, 241 AH/ 2 August,
          855 at the age of 74–75 in Baghdad, Iraq. Historians relate that his
          funeral was attended by 800,000 men and 60,000 women and that 20,000
          Christians and Jews converted to Islam on that day.
        </li>
        <li>
          His qabr (grave) is located in the premises of the Imam Ahmad Bin
          Hanbal Shrine in Ar-Rusafa District
