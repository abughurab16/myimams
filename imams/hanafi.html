      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Born 699 (80 Hijri) Kufa, Umayyad Caliphate during the reign of the
          Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, now modern day Iraq.
        </li>
        <li>Abū Ḥanīfah was born 67 years after the death of Muhammad(ﷺ)</li>
        <li>
          Abu Hanifa studied at Kufa and gradually gained influence as an
          authority on legal questions
        </li>
        <li>
          Abū Ḥanīfah was arrested by al-Mansur, the Abbasid ruler, locked in
          prison and tortured. He was never fed nor cared for.Even there, the
          jurist continued to teach those who were permitted to come to him.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abu Hanifa had studied with prominent figures as Muhammad Bin Ali Bin
          Al-Husayn Bin Ali Ibn Abi Talib and Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman.
        </li>
        <li>On 15 Rajab 150(August 15, 767), Abū Ḥanīfah died in prison</li>
        <li>
          It was said that so many people attended his funeral that the funeral
          service was repeated six times for more than 50,000 people who had
          amassed before he was actually buried.
        </li>
        <li>
          The tomb of Abū Ḥanīfah and the tomb of Abdul Qadir Gilani were
          destroyed by Shah Ismail of Safavi empire in 1508. In 1533, Ottomans
          conquered Baghdad and rebuilt the tomb of Abū Ḥanīfah and other Sunni
          sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some followers call him al-Imām al-Aʿẓam ("The Greatest Imam") and
          Sirāj al-aʾimma ("The Lamp of the Imams") in Sunni Islam.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abū Ḥanīfah is regarded by some as one of the Tabi‘un, the generation
          after the Sahaba, who were the companions of the Islamic prophet,
          Muhammad. This is based on reports that he met at least four Sahaba
          including Anas ibn Malik, with some even reporting that he
          transmitted Hadith from him and other companions of Muhammad.Others
          take the view that Abū Ḥanīfah only saw around half a dozen
          companions, possibly at a young age, and did not directly narrate
          hadith from them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Sources and Methodology</h3>
      <h3>
        The sources from which Abu Hanifa derived Islamic law, in order of
        importance and preference, are: the Qur'an, the authentic narrations of
        the Muslim prophet Muhammad (known as hadith), consensus of the Muslim
        community (ijma), analogical reasoning (qiyas), juristic discretion
        (istihsan) and the customs of the local population enacting said law
        (urf).
