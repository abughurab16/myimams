      <h4>Some Points And Accomplishments of Imam Malik</h3>
      <ul class="list">
          <li>Born 711 CE/93 AH Madina, Umayyad Caliphate</li>
          <li>Living in Medina gave Malik access to some of the most learned minds of early Islam. He memorized the Quran in his youth, learning recitation from Abu Suhail Nafi' ibn 'Abd ar-Rahman, from whom he also received his Ijazah(permission to teach)</li>
          <li>Malik's chain of narrators was considered the most authentic and called Silsilat al-Dhahab or "The Golden Chain of Narrators" by notable hadith scholars including Muhammad al-Bukhari.</li>
          <li>He studied under various famed scholars including Hisham ibn Urwah and Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri</li>
          <li>Malik seems to have been a proponent of intercession in personal supplication</li>
          <li>Malik was a strong proponent of combining the "inward science" ('ilm al-bātin) of mystical knowledge with the "outward science" of jurisprudence</li>
          <li>Malik said: "He who practices Sufism (tasawwuf) without learning Sacred Law corrupts his faith (tazandaqa), while he who learns Sacred Law without practicing Sufism corrupts himself (tafassaqa). Only he who combines the two proves true (tahaqqaqa)."</li>
          <li>Malik's unique contributions to the field of theology specifically is that he was a strict opponent of anthropomorphism,[18] and deemed it absurd to compare the attributes of God, which were given in "human imagery" such as that of God's "hands" or "eyes" with those of man.</li>
          <li>Malik was a supporter of tabarruk or the "seeking of blessing through [the veneration of] relics.</li>
          <li>Malik is famous for declaring: "The shield of the 'alim is: 'I do not know.'</li>
          <li>Malik died at the age of 83 or 84 in Medina in 795 CE, and is buried in the cemetery of Al-Baqi', across from the Mosque of the Prophet.</li>
