        Abū ʿAbdillāh Muhammad ibn Idrīs al-Shāfiʿī was an Arab Muslim theologian,
        writer, and scholar, who was the first contributor of the principles of
        Islamic jurisprudence (Uṣūl al-fiqh). Often referred to as 'Shaykh
        al-Islām', al-Shāfi‘ī was one of the four great Sunni Imams, whose legacy
        on juridical matters and teaching eventually led to the formation of
        Shafi'i school of fiqh (or Madh'hab). He was the most prominent student of
        Imam Malik ibn Anas, and he also served as the Governor of Najar.
      </h3>
      <h4>Some Points And Accomplishments of al-Shafi'i</h4>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Born in Gaza in Palestine (Jund Filastin), he also lived in Mecca and
          Medina in the Hejaz, Yemen, Egypt, and Baghdad in Iraq.
        </li>
        <li>
          Al-Shāfi‘ī belonged to the Qurayshi clan of Banu Muttalib, which was the
          sister clan of the Banu Hashim, to which Muhammad(ﷺ) and the 'Abbasid
          caliphs belonged.
        </li>
        <li>
          He studied under Muslim ibn Khalid az-Zanji, the Mufti of Mecca then,
          who is thus considered to be the first teacher of Imam al-Shāfi‘ī.
        </li>
        <li>
          By the age of seven, al-Shāfi‘ī had memorized the Qur’an. At ten, he had
          committed Imam Malik's Muwatta' to heart, at which time his teacher
          would deputize him to teach in his absence. Al-Shāfi‘ī was authorized to
          issue fatwas at the age of fifteen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Al-Shāfi‘ī moved to Al-Medinah in a desire for further legal training,as
          was the tradition of acquiring knowledge. Accounts differ on the age in
          which he set out to Medina; an account placed his age at thirteen, while
          another stated that he was in his twenties. There, he was taught for
          many years by the famous Imam Malik ibn Anas, who was impressed with his
          memory, knowledge and intelligence.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the age of thirty, al-Shāfi‘ī was appointed as the ‘Abbasid governor
          in the Yemeni city of Najran.
        </li>
        <li>
          Al-Shāfi'ī traveled to Baghdad to study with Abu Hanifah's acolyte
          al-Shaybānī and others. It was here that he developed his first
          madh'hab, influenced by the teachings of both Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam
          Malik
        </li>
        <li>
          At least one authority states that al-Shāfi'ī died as a result of
          injuries sustained from an attack by supporters of a Maliki follower
          named Fityan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, an 18th century Sunni Islamic scholar stated:
          <em>A Mujadid appears at the end of every century: The Mujtahid of the 1st century was Imam of Ahlul Sunnah, Umar bin Abdul Aziz. The Mujadid of the 2nd century was Imam of Ahlul Sunnah Muhammad Idrees as-Shafi'i the Mujadid of the 3rd century was Imam of Ahlul Sunnah Abu Hasan Ashari the Mujadid of the 4th century was Abu Abdullah Hakim Nishapuri.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Al-Shāfi'ī died at the age of 54 on the 30th of Rajab in 204 AH (20
          January 820 CE), in Al-Fustat, Egypt, and was buried in the vault of the
          Banū ‘Abd al-Hakam, near Mount al-Muqattam.
        </li>
      </ul>
