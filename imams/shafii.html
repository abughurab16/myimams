      Abū ʿAbdillāh Muhammad ibn Idrīs al-Shāfiʿī was an Arab Muslim theologian,
      writer, and scholar, who was the first contributor of the principles of
      Islamic jurisprudence (Uṣūl al-fiqh). Often referred to as 'Shaykh
      al-Islām', al-Shāfi‘ī was one of the four great Sunni Imams, whose legacy
      on juridical matters and teaching eventually led to the formation of
      Shafi'i school of fiqh (or Madh'hab). He was the most prominent student of
      Imam Malik ibn Anas, and he also served as the Governor of Najar.

    <h4>Some Points And Accomplishments of al-Shafi'i</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Born in Gaza in Palestine (Jund Filastin), he also lived in Mecca and Medina in the Hejaz, Yemen, Egypt, and Baghdad in Iraq.</li>
        <li>Al-Shāfi‘ī belonged to the Qurayshi clan of Banu Muttalib, which was the sister clan of the Banu Hashim, to which Muhammad(ﷺ) and the 'Abbasid caliphs belonged.</li>
        <li>He studied under Muslim ibn Khalid az-Zanji, the Mufti of Mecca then, who is thus considered to be the first teacher of Imam al-Shāfi‘ī.</li>
        <li> By the age of seven, al-Shāfi‘ī had memorized the Qur’an. At ten, he had committed Imam Malik's Muwatta' to heart, at which time his teacher would deputize him to teach in his absence. Al-Shāfi‘ī was authorized to issue fatwas at the age of fifteen.</li>
